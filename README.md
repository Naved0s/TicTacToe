# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe project in Flutter is a simple mobile application that allows users to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game on their smartphones. Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Here's a brief description of how a Tic Tac Toe project in Flutter might be structured:

1)UI Design:
The app typically has a simple interface with a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
Each cell in the grid can be empty, marked with an 'X', or marked with an 'O'.
Display areas for player turns, game status (win, draw), and a reset button.

2)State Management:
Flutter uses a widget-based architecture, and the game state is managed by Flutter's built-in StatefulWidget or a state management solution like Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod.
The state includes the current player's turn, the state of each cell in the grid, and the game's status (ongoing, won, or drawn).

3)Game Logic:
The game logic determines the winner based on the rules of Tic Tac Toe: a player wins if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The game logic also checks for a draw if the entire board is filled without a winner.

4)User Interaction:
Users can tap on empty cells to make a move.
The app responds to user input, updates the game state, and re-renders the UI.
